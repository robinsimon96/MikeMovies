		<h2>MICHAEL SIMON</h2>
		<p>Emerson College, Junior</p>
		
		<p class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6">Michael Simon is currently a junior at Emerson College in Boston, Massachusetts. He is a Political Communications Major with a Double Minor in Marketing Communications and Leadership and Management. Planning to go to Law School after college, he has created his college’s first Pre-Law student organization and is working to produce the school’s first televised mock trial. Beyond that, he has produced and worked television shows on the Emerson Channel and Emerson Independent Video. In his spare time, he adores watching movies and television shows, which is where this site comes into play as a place to put all those thoughts in one place. Enjoy!</p>
